# WAV Monitoring Summaries

The [**Water Action Volunteers (WAV)**](https://wateractionvolunteers.org/){target="_blank"} program is a statewide network of citizen scientist volunteers committed to monitoring as much of Wisconsin's 86,000+ miles of streams and rivers as possible.

Our aim is to preserve, protect and restore the state's streams and rivers by collecting high-quality stream data that's useful for decision-making and natural resource management.

Every year, volunteers monitor more than 600 stream locations throughout Wisconsin. This effort wouldn't be possible without the ongoing partnership between [**University of Wisconsin–Madison Division of Extension**](https://extension.wisc.edu/){target="_blank"}, the [**Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources**](https://dnr.wi.gov/){target="_blank"} (WDNR) and, of course, our dedicated volunteers.

# Visit the data dashboard

The best way to interact with the data our volunteers collect is to visit our [**online data dashboard**](https://connect.doit.wisc.edu/wav-dashboard/){target="_blank"}. Here you can view and interact with water quality data collected since 2015.
